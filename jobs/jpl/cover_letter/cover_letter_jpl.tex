\noindent To whom it may concern,
\\ \\
My name is Carson. I live in Scotland where I'm pursuing a PhD in robotics and graphics, with a focus on novel light field parameterizations and applications. If given the opportunity, I would absolutely take it to join JPL for an internship as, like so many, I'm enamoured with the work being done there and feel with my speciality I could make meaningful contributions in image collection, VR, or SLAM and other robot applications. I'm well-versed in my field, with over a year's worth of research and literature review being completed to date.
\\ \\ 
On a more personal level, I enjoy a riveting puzzle and can confidently work my way through complex debugging or deciphering of previously written code. I have a diverse background, but have shown considerable depth in particular areas of research and feel I am capable of pushing the state of the art. I believe I am an excellent candidate and would love the chance at an internship at JPL.
\\ \\
Thank you for taking the time to read this,
\\ \\
Carson Vogt
