\noindent To whom it may concern at Raytrix,
\\ \\
My name is Carson Vogt, I am currently a student at Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh Universities, working towards earning my PhD in Electrical Engineering with a focus on light fields. It is largely because of this and the fact that I will be using Raytrix cameras during my research that I am interested in doing an internship with the company.
\\ \\
I have spent the last 10 months understanding the light field domain and feel I have an excellent understanding of how they are collected and rendered. Not only that, I've learned some of the unique ways in which they can be used apart from VR and photography, and some of the effects that can be created with the data obtained from them, such as reconstructing occluded surfaces.
\\ \\
Conclusion, this is why I'd be a good intern, what I could contribute
