Papers submitted to ICCP 2020 should be in IEEE Computer society
*journal* style, but anonymized to remove author names and associated
identifying information (acknowledgments, biographies, etc.) and with
line-numbers to assist reviewers in referring to specific portions of
the manuscript during review.

Submitted papers should also fit within 11 pages including
references. Final camera ready submissions should fit within 12 pages,
after including author biographies.

Please see the iccp20_template.tex file for an example paper. This can
be used as a starting point for your own manuscript.

Note: The lipsum package is only used in the template to generate
random text. If you do not have the package installed in your LaTeX
installation, simply remove the \usepackage{lipsum} and all \lipsum
commands.
